# ytinfo

A minimal library for extracting video metadata and info from YouTube. Currently has functions for getting video details, thumbnails, and a channel's entire video list.

Some extraction logic was based on [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl). I made this mostly for study purposes and because I wanted to use a lighter library for my own scraping scripts.
